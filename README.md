# hOCR-to-ALTO
Convert between Tesseract hOCR and ALTO XML 2.0/2.1 using XSL stylesheets

The XSLT scripts are written as XSLT 2.0 scripts, so they require an XSLT 2.0
capable transformer, like [Saxon](http://www.saxonica.com/ce/user-doc/1.1/).

See [ocr-fileformat](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/ocr-fileformat) for an
interface to using these stylesheets.
